Then, a simulation was conducted in which that the null hypothesis was assumed. In other words, the proportions were 0.5 for supporters and opposers to see if getting a statistic of 0.697 was by chance alone. After running this simulation many, many times and graphing the results, the sampling distribution showed the probabilties of getting different observed statistics."

    "text": "Analysis\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that getting the observed statistic of about 0.697 results in a p-value of 0.004. Since the p-value is less than the standarized value of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis stating that there is no difference. We can therefore conclude that there is evidence that there is a difference between these two proportions since getting a statistic of 0.697 for those who support marijuana occurs rarely with luck.\nSource: This dataset was from the USA Survey, collected from July 8-11.
