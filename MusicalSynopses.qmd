### Effect of Words in a Synopsis on Weekly Gross Overall

#### Joining the 'grosses' and 'synopses' dataset

```{r}
shows_combined <- 
  dplyr::full_join(grosses, synopses, by = "show") 
```

#### Word: Musical
```{r}
synopsis_musical_count <- shows_combined |>
  mutate(musical_count = str_count(synopsis, "(?i)\\bmusical\\b")) |> # Counting the number of times 'musical' appears in the synopsis
  select(show, weekly_gross, synopsis, musical_count) # Selecting these specific columns in the dataframe

synopsis_musical_count |> 
  filter(!is.na(musical_count)) |> # Filtering for values that are not NA
  mutate(weekly_gross = weekly_gross/1000) |> # Creating a new column that puts the gross in thousands 
  select(musical_count, weekly_gross) |> # Selecting these columns
  arrange(desc(musical_count)) |> # Arranging in descending order by musical_count
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(musical_count), y = weekly_gross)) + # Defining the variables and ordering musical_count 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "pink", color = "black", outlier.color = "lightgreen") + # Assigning colors
  labs (
    title = "Relationship Between 'Musical' Count in Synopsis and Weekly Gross",
    subtitle = "Influence of 'Musical' keyword frequency", 
    x = "Number of Times 'Musical' Appears in Synopsis", 
    y = "Weekly Gross Revenue (in thousands)"
  ) + # Renaming variables for clarity
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) + # Theme 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),  # Centering and bold the title
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, face = "italic"),  # Subtitle formatting
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),  # Bolding axis labels
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),  # Making axis text bigger
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray", size = 0.5),  # Lighter gridlines
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # No minor gridlines
  )
```

The graph above illustrates the difference between the weekly grosses depending on the amount of times the word "musical" appears in synopses. From this graph, we can determine that there is little correlation between the weekly grosses and the word "musical". In other words, it seems that it does not matter whether the word "musical" appears more in the synopsis. For example, the median weekly gross for count = 1 and count = 4 does not have a huge difference. Therefore, the number of times the word "musical" appears in the synopsis does not make a difference.

#### Word: Play

```{r}
synopsis_play_count <- shows_combined |>
  mutate(play_count = str_count(synopsis, "(?i)\\bplay\\b")) |>
  select(show, weekly_gross, synopsis, play_count)

synopsis_play_count |>
  filter(!is.na(play_count)) |>
  mutate(weekly_gross = weekly_gross/1000) |>
  select(play_count, weekly_gross) |>
  arrange(desc(play_count)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(play_count), y = weekly_gross)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "pink", color = "black", outlier.color = "lightgreen") +
  labs (
    title = "Relationship Between 'Play' Count in Synopsis and Weekly Gross",
    subtitle = "Influence of 'Play' keyword frequency", 
    x = "Number of Times 'Play' Appears in Synopsis", 
    y = "Weekly Gross Revenue (in thousands)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) + # Theme 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),  # Centering and bold the title
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, face = "italic"),  # Subtitle formatting
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),  # Bolding axis labels
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),  # Making axis text bigger
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray", size = 0.5),  # Lighter gridlines
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # No minor gridlines
  )
```
The graph above is similar to the graph comparing musical count in synopses and the weekly gross. These box-plots show a similar trend in which there is little correlation between the play count and the weekly gross. 

### Effect of Artistic Characters on Weekly Gross

```{r}
artist_characters <- shows_combined |>
  mutate(synopsis_lower = str_to_lower(synopsis),
         is_artist = str_detect(synopsis_lower, "(singer|playwright|actor|chorus|dancer)")) |>
  select(show, weekly_gross, synopsis, is_artist)


artist_characters |>
  filter(!is.na(is_artist)) |>
  mutate(weekly_gross = weekly_gross/1000) |>
  select(is_artist, weekly_gross) |>
  arrange(desc(is_artist)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = is_artist, y = weekly_gross)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "pink", color = "black", outlier.color = "lightgreen") +
  labs (
    title = "Shows with Artistic Characters vs Weekly Gross",
    subtitle = "Impact of Artistic Themes on Revenue",
    x = "Contains Artistic Characters", 
    y = "Weekly Gross Revenue"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),  # Centering and bold the title
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, face = "italic"),  # Subtitle formatting
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),  # Bolding axis labels
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),  # Making axis text bigger
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray", size = 0.5),  # Lighter gridlines
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # No minor gridlines
  )
```
This graph determines whether the synopsis features an artistic character and its affect on weekly gross. We can define an artistic character as a singer, playwright, actor, chorus (member), and/or dancer. It was hypothesized that it would increase weekly gross because artistic characters could appeal as more relatable to audiences. The results support this hypothesis because when the synopsis does mention an artistic character, the interquartile range is higher. 

### Effect of Synopsis Length on Weekly Gross

```{r}
words_synopsis <- shows_combined |>
  mutate(synopsis_count = str_count(synopsis, "\\S+")) |>
  select(show, weekly_gross, synopsis, synopsis_count)

words_synopsis |>
  filter(!is.na(synopsis_count)) |>
  mutate(weekly_gross = weekly_gross/1000) |>
  select(synopsis_count, weekly_gross) |>
  arrange(desc(synopsis_count)) |>
  head(1000) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(synopsis_count), y = weekly_gross)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "pink", color = "black", outlier.color = "lightgreen") +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs (
    title = "Top Synopsis Lengths vs Weekly Gross",
    x = "Synopsis Length", 
    y = "Weekly Gross"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),  # Centering and bold the title
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, face = "italic"),  # Subtitle formatting
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),  # Bolding axis labels
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),  # Making axis text bigger
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray", size = 0.5),  # Lighter gridlines
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # No minor gridlines
  )
```
This graph demonstrates the comparison between how long the synopsis is and the weekly gross of each show. It took the top 1000 shows with the highest lengths. From the box-plots, no correlation can be seen between the length and weekly gross. 

### Effect of Words in a Synopsis on Weekly Gross Overall

#### Word: Musical

```{r}
shows_combined$synopsis <- as.character(shows_combined$synopsis)

shows_combined$is_musical <- str_detect(shows_combined$synopsis, regex("musical", ignore_case = TRUE))

shows_combined |>
  filter(!is.na(is_musical)) |>
  mutate(weekly_gross = weekly_gross/1000) |>
  select(weekly_gross_overall, is_musical) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = is_musical, y = log10(weekly_gross_overall))) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "pink", color = "black", outlier.color = "lightgreen") +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs (
    title = "Synopsis with 'Musical' vs Weekly Gross Overall",
    x = "Musical?", 
    y = "Weekly Gross Overall"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),  # Centering and bold the title
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, face = "italic"),  # Subtitle formatting
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),  # Bolding axis labels
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),  # Making axis text bigger
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray", size = 0.5),  # Lighter gridlines
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # No minor gridlines
  )
```
These two box-plots determine whether a synopsis with the word "musical" in it or not affects the weekly gross OVERALL. This is difference from the first graph regarding musical count because it is not counting the amount of times "musical" appears, and it is compared to the weekly gross overall for all shows. This trend shows no difference since the medians are about the same. 

#### Word: Play

```{r}
shows_combined$synopsis <- as.character(shows_combined$synopsis)

shows_combined$is_play <- str_detect(shows_combined$synopsis, regex("play", ignore_case = TRUE))

shows_combined

shows_combined |>
  filter(!is.na(is_play)) |>
  select(weekly_gross_overall, is_play) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = is_play, y = log10(weekly_gross_overall))) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs (
    title = "Synopsis with 'Play' vs Weekly Gross Overall",
    x = "Play?", 
    y = "Weekly Gross Overall"
  )
```
This graph is similar to the previous one, except it determines whether "play" appears in the synopsis and its effect on the weekly gross overall. The trend is almost the same as the last, for it shows little difference between the two variables.
